Miscellaneous coding challenges that I gone and did.

## Guy sitting on a mountain peak

Given a list of positive integers, this will draw a mountain range. It interprets the numbers as as alternating up and down slopes, and it draws a guy sitting the tallest slope.

To use, change the `data` list at the top of `peak.py`.

### Example

```
data = [5, 2, 4, 2, 7, 2]

                    o
                   /|\
                   < >
                   / \
                  /   \
                 /
                /
               /
          /\  /
         /  \/
    /\  /
   /  \/

## Euler solutions
Solutions to selected Problem Euler problems. Only problems 1-100 are
allowed to be shared.

Most of these are in python, but some of them leverage sagemath and
can be run in the command line with `sage example.py`.
